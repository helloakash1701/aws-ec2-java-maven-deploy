# AWS EC2 Java Maven Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a Java Maven project on an AWS EC2 instance. The example assumes you have a project with a frontend and backend, and you want to deploy the backend to an EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with access to create EC2 instances.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your local machine.
- Maven installed on your local machine.
- SSH key pair for connecting to the EC2 instance.

## Steps

### 1. Launch an EC2 Instance

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click "Launch Instance" and choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that suits your requirements.
4. Configure the instance details, such as instance type, security groups, and key pair. Make sure to configure security groups to allow SSH (port 22) and any other required ports.
5. Launch the instance and select your SSH key pair to access the instance.

### 2. SSH into the EC2 Instance

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
2. Use the following command to SSH into the EC2 instance:

   ```sh
   ssh -i /path/to/your/private-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
   ```

### 3. Set Up Java and Maven on the EC2 Instance

1. Update the package lists:

   ```sh
   sudo yum update
   ```

2. Install Java and Maven:

   ```sh
   sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
   sudo yum install maven
   ```

### 4. Clone Your Backend Repository

1. Use `git clone` to clone your backend repository into the EC2 instance:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-repo.git
   ```

### 5. Build and Deploy the Backend

1. Navigate to your backend project directory:

   ```sh
   cd your-backend-repo
   ```

2. Build the Maven project:

   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```sh
   java -jar target/your-backend-jar.jar
   ```

### 6. Access the Deployed Backend

1. Open a web browser and enter your EC2 instance's public IP followed by the backend port (if applicable) to access the deployed backend.

### 7. Domain Configuration (Optional)

1. If you have a custom domain, configure DNS settings to point to your EC2 instance's public IP.

### 8. Continuous Deployment (Optional)

1. Set up a continuous deployment pipeline to automate deployments whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully deployed your Java Maven backend on an AWS EC2 instance. You can now integrate your frontend with the backend APIs and make your application accessible to users.
